     <h1 class="title">Peggy Seeger: 'Folk is full of raunchy songs, but they're not often sung'</h1>
        <article class="article">
            <p>
        
                The New York-born folk musician Peggy Seeger, 85, has been working and touring non-stop since she was 17. In 1958 she wed a friend so that she could stay in the UK with her already-married lover, Ewan MacColl. She and MacColl went on to make more than 40 albums together, marry and have three children. Seeger’s partner of the past 30 years is the traditional singer Irene Pyper-Scott, who lives in New Zealand; Seeger lives in Iffley, Oxford. She has just released her 24th solo album, First Farewell – her first to be recorded solely with family members.

                How has the pandemic been for you?
        
                I was meant to be touring last year with my son Calum. Travelling with all our gear in the back: 26 dates, a fantastic tour, all slashed off, bang. I was doing tours on my own until I was 79, including standing at my merch table. That’s why I’ve got so many grey hairs. Now I grieve so much for the people who have died because of this pandemic. I also grieve for people of my age losing their last years to Covid-19.

                Your partner lives in New Zealand. How has that been?
        
                We talk twice every day in the three-hour windows where we’re both awake, trying not to despair. She couldn’t cope with living in the UK [before the pandemic]. It was too crowded for her and too cold, and I couldn’t live there. She is living a completely normal life over there – more of a normal life than ever before, I’d say. They’re lucky in New Zealand. Unlike us, they have a sensible prime minister.
