            <mark>Marie Lang</mark> (8 March 1858 – 14 October 1934) was an Austrian feminist, theosophist and publisher. Born in 1858 in Vienna, <mark>Lang</mark> was raised in a liberal, upper-middle-class home. <img src="Marie_Lang_in_chair.jpg" class="imagec" alt="Marie_Lang_in_chair" > After divorcing her first husband in 1884, she married Edmund Lang and the two hosted an influential salon for politicians and intellectuals.

        At the end of the 1880s, <mark>Lang</mark> was introduced to the women's movement by her friends, Auguste Fickert and Mayreder. She quickly became one of the most prominent women's rights activists of her era. In 1891, <mark>Lang's</mark> daughter Lilith was born, for whom Mayreder would serve as godmother.

        In 1893, the Allgemeiner Österreichischer Frauenverein (General Austrian Women's Association) was formed by <mark>Lang</mark>, Fickert, and Mayreder, as one of the radical organizations in the Viennese women's movement. More similar to organizations developed for workers than middle- and upper-class women's groups, which focused on charity, the Frauenverein supported working class rights to employment, education and legal protection for the poor, and the abolition of laws regulating prostitution.
